    <h5>Gnocci on a blue plate, ganished with parsley</h5>
    <p>Gnocchi is simple to make with just three ingredients: mashed potato, flour, and egg. This recipe is one my
        family has used for generations.</p>
    <p>
        Gnocchi (singular gnocco) are Italian dumplings made with flour, eggs, and potatoes. Gnocchi can be served in
        tomato sauce, tossed with pesto, or saut√©ed with butter and herbs.
